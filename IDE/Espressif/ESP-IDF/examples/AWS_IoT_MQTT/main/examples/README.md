# Example Code

When compiling code from a GitHub repository,
this directory is expected to be empty (other than this README file).

When compiling from a Managed Component example, or an otherwise stand-alone example, this directory should contain code copied from:

```
https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfMQTT/tree/master/examples/
```

Typical contents:

```
mqttexample.c
mqttexample.h
mqttnet.c
mqttnet.h
mqttport.c
mqttport.h
mqttuart.c
```

For the AWS example, there should also be a [aws](./aws) directory.
