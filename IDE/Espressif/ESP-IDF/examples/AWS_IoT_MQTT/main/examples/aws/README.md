# Example Code

When compiling code from a GitHub repository,
this directory is expected to be empty (other than this README file).

When compiling from a Managed Component example, or an otherwise stand-alone example, this directory should contain code copied from:

```
https://github.com/wolfSSL/wolfMQTT/tree/master/examples/aws
```

Typical contents:

```
awsiot.c
awsiot.h
```
